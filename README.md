# Calum Craft

Calum Craft is a re-creation of the popular game Minecraft using pyglet to leverage openGL in python

The implementation uses perlin noise to generate random map terrain for different biomes and utilizes math functions to implement 3D collision detection, player movement and sight

To play, download the files and run the main script. The user must have pyglet and noise installed for the game to run:

So, go to the directory the files were downloaded to and run:

```
pip3 install pyglet
pip3 install noise
```

Then run the script using

```
python3 main.py
```
